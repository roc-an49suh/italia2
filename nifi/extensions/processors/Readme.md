# Custom processors

## Daf pre-standardization

The goal of this processor is to create the function call and the parameters need to apply
the standardization process to the input dataset as explained [here](https://daf-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datamgmt/dataset_conventions.html#ingestion-pipeline-steps).

Additional documentation can be found [here](./daf-prestandardization.md).
